# Cash-transfers-and-employability_Brazil
## Standard OLS and dprobit model

### Findings
- Clients of Bolsa Familia (BF), a program that transfers money to the poorest families in the country, are finding jobs faster than other poor groups.
- Once they start working, only half of beneciaries remain employed after a year compared to two-thirds of other poor groups. 
- Jobs created in Brazil are concentrated in i) low skills, ii) micro and small rms and iii) regions where many beneciaries reside. 
- Beneficiaries are not losing their jobs because these disappear, because they are undereducated, due to opportunity costs or lack of job-seeking networks. It is the difference in accumulated experience vis-Ã -vis other poor groups that is making beneciaries lose their jobs faster.

### Suggestions
- Complementing classroom training with apprenticeships would enable BF recipients to put recently acquired skills into practice and keep their jobs. 
- We recommend to the Ministries of Social Development to provide apprenticeships in micro and small firms to help beneciaries develop skills that firms demand. 

### Methodology
- Stage 1: Investigate the effect of demand, supply and job matching variables on i) job duration (which we use as proxy for rate of job loss) and ii) probability of unemployment. We used i) a standard OLS regression to identify the variables that explain expected job duration and ii) a probit regression to explain probability of unemployment. Both regression specications will use location (rural or urban), region, and occupation fixed effects.
- Stage 2: Test the following hypotheses in the three major factors affecting higher job loss and unemployment:

**01. Supply**

       (a) BF beneciaries are still severely undereducated and thus less likely to be productive once hired;
       (b) Once employed, female beneciaries (majority of BF beneciaries) tend to lose or quit jobs because of opportunity costs at home (childcare and housekeeping);

**02. Demand**

    - (a) Jobs are being created by small, non-productive firms that tend to shut down in a few years;
    - (b) Jobs are being destroyed in places with high concentration of BF beneciaries.

**03. Job Matching**

    - (a) BF beneciaries are newcomers to job markets, and a good match is unlikely in their first or second job (under this hypothesis, high turnover is not necessarily negative);
    - (b) Beneciaries find jobs mostly through informal social networks, and may not seek all vacancies available.
    - (c) Firms are having a hard time to fill positions that require some qualication.
